        <h3>Beyond Work</h3>
        <p>
            Work is only a small fraction of life. I enjoy my life outside software development world as well.
            I am a huge musical fan, and I have been taking voice classes for years. I also enjoy writing song
            (only the lyrics) and I sometiems post my work on youtube and bilibili.

            I also enjoy playing video games. Fun fact, I did game streaming for a really short period of time for an fps
            game called "Call of Duty: Warzone". I was not the best player but I definitely brought a lot of fun
            to my friends and viewers. I am playing or have played before games like APEX, League of Legends, TFT and so on.
            Besides multiplayer competitive games, I also enjoy playing indie games just by myself. 
            In fact my favorite game of all time is be Stardew Valley, an indie game with farming and crafting simulation.

            I know four human languages and many more programming languages. I enjoy learning languages in general because
            I believe that one of the best ways to understand somebody elses' cultures is through the languages. Born and raised
            in Shanghai, China, I know Mandarin Chinese as my native tone. I started learning English at the age of 4. As a teenager,
            I fell in love with anime and games just like some of my peers, and I decided to minor in Japanese in college. I started
            to learn Spanish two years into my fulltime job, since I want to visit Southern America sometime.

            When I am not gaming or singing, I am probably reading books or hitting the gym. I also enjoy spending my weekends
            hiking in the beautiful mountains of San Fracisco Bay Area with my friends.
